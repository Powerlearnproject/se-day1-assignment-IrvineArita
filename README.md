Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

 Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is a systematic approach to designing, testing and mantaining software. It applies engineering principles to software development to ensure reliable, scalable and meets user needs. it is also the backbone of modern technology.
Importance: it is essential for enhancing creativity and productivity. 
Scability and relialibilty- well engineered softwares  can handle a large amount of data and users without performance issues and also system rely on software engineering principles for scalability.
Cybersecurity and data protection- it ensures secure applications through encryption, authentication and regular security updates.

 Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering machine (1956-1967)- developed hardware dependent high level languages.
Mastering process(1968-1982)- development process of software engineering to ensure correctness. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modelling that enabled implentation automation.
Mastering complexity(1983-1992)- expanded data and functional convergence  and reused new programming approach 
Mastering communications(1993-2001)- emergence of internet brought with it a new software concept.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning -  the software requirement, purpose, scope,goals and feasibility are defined.
 requirement analysis - Gathering detailed requirements from users, translating them into technical specifications that guide the development. 
design - building the blueprint framework for the software. 
Implementation (coding)- writing the actual code based on design specifications..
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
Deployment_  moving the completed software to production environment to make it accessible to users.
Maintenance- ongoing updates, bug fixes and improvements to sotware.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodology places emphasis  on flexible, iterative progress by breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable units of work while the waterfall methodology is a rigid, highly structured approach that requires execution of the project to be defined before any work can begin.
Agile methodology; clients and external stakeholders are involved at every step of the way.
                  deliverables and products are turned over the throughout the project lifecycle, not only at conclusion.
                  projects move more quickly due to a high level of flexibility.
*Its best used in advertising and marketing. due to its flexibility, its a great fit for advertisers and marketers who regularly update their projects according to recent trends.
Waterfall methodology; clients are not involved in any project details until conclusion.
                       deliverables and products are only delivered to stakeholders upon project completion.
                       projects often take longer especially in project planning phase.
 * its best used for Healthcare. industries that are strictly regulated like Healthcare benefit immensely from structured and standardized approach waterfall methodology.
                         
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
*Roles and responsibilities of a project manager 
Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget.
Manages and motivates the software development team.
Discusses the project and its requirements with clients and software developers.
Supervises each stage of the software development project.
* Roles and responsibilities of a software developer
  Engineers and stabilizes the product
  solves any technical roblems emerging  during the development lifescycle.
  Developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
* Roles and resposibilities of  a quality assurance engineer 
  Makes sure an application performs according to requirements.
  Spots functional and non-functional defects.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.  it increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, budgeting and packaging in an easy-to-use application. 
Importance; it is useful in code editing automation, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, refactory support, complitation, testing, debugging and local build automation.
examples include IntelliJ, Eclipse and Visual studio.
A Version Control System (VCS)is a a system that  tracks and manages changes to files over time. it is also known as source control. 
Importance; coloboration, error correction, reproducibility and accountability. 
examples includ Subversion(SVN) and Microsoft Team Foundation Version Control(TFVC)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Technical challenges such as debugging complex code which can be time consuming, compatibility isues wen coonecting different applications can lead to complex development processes.
solution; utilizing debugging  tools and write clean and modular code. applying  establised design patterns to create mantainable and scalable code.
-Uncontrolled changes  to project requiremenys during development leading to delays and budget overruns.
solution; employ flexile development approaches to adapt to requirements.
-Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
-Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests- are very low level and close to application. consist in testing individual methods and functions of classes, components or modules used by your software. 
Intergation tests- Verify that different modules of services used by your application work well together . E.g it can be testing the  interaction with the  database or make sue microservices work together  as expected.  Are more expensive to run.
System tests- evaluates the software system as a whole ti ensure it meets itsrequirements. its conducted before intergration testing.
Acceptance tests- it ensures the softwaremeets the end user's needs and business criteria. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the practice of designing and refining prompts- question or instructions - to elicit specific responses from AI models. 
Improves user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
Increases flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt;  I need a book to read.
Improved prompt; can you suggest  a science fiction novel with strong  female  protagonists?
Explanation; the first propmt is open-ended and could result in any kind of book reccomendation. second prompt is clear about the genre  and character preference, ensuring that the  recommendation will be tailored to The user's specific intrests.
